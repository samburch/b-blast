# b-blast

A fun little 'astroids' style Object Orientated JavaScript game I created using Canvas and WebGL.

Simply click the mouse to start blasting the different colourd balls that start to move towards you.

The game tracks your score as you go - 10 points for a hit and 100 for destriying enemies.
If you receive Game Over, the game checks to see if you have a new high score.

In the future i intend to implement:

1. Levels that scale difficulty
2. Time tracking
3. Movement controls
4. Pause feature
5. Save feature (client based)

Feel free to download and try. All logic contained within one JS file for now.
